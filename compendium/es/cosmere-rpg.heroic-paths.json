Experience teaches the most important lesson: you don’t have to be more powerful than your quarry, so long as you’re better prepared.<\/p><p>Through careful planning, Hunters choose when and where to strike, securing an upper hand through clever use of traps, high ground, and the element of surprise. If all goes well, the quarry won’t perceive their assailant until it’s too late. Some Hunters prefer a clean kill from afar. Others make their work personal, striking in close quarters and taking pleasure in their prey’s visceral panic; nothing feels sweeter than methodical preparation culminating in an exhilarating onslaught.<\/p><h3>Hunter Specialties<\/h3><p>The Hunter path presents talents in three specialties:<\/p><p><strong>Archer.<\/strong> Targeting weak points in an enemy army’s assault, Archers shape the battlefield before the frontline confrontation.
